# Water Quality Monitoring System using IoT devices
> Water quality is a critical issue in IIT Jodhpur, one of India's premier engineering institutions. Ensuring access to clean and safe water for various purposes is essential for the well-being and health of the campus community. This project focuses on the water quality concerns in IIT Jodhpur and explores potential measures to address this issue. Implementing a robust water quality monitoring system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology can help regularly assess and analyze the water for potential contaminants. The system measures key water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, and TDS in different locations and transmits the data to a cloud server for analysis and storage. The system aims to provide real-time and efficient water quality monitoring, promoting environmental sustainability and helping to ensure safe drinking water.



## Usage 

1. On Landing Page of Dashboard, All locations and sensors avaliable on that location would be shown and there would be change in values in Real-Time on Dashboard. 
2. We can see the Last 30 values of each sensor in graphical manner. 
1. One can add a new Location in the dashboard. 
2. One can see the all locations created and can delete them. 
2. There can be three types of sensors that can be added in a location are Water Temperature sensor, Water pH sensor and Water TDS sensor. 
3. These three sensor will provide the readings when they actually will get implemented in a particular location. 
4. When a new sensor would be added to a particular location, he/she will get a unique sensorID. This sensorID would be sent along with the sensor data and It would be sent by that particular sensor. This task would be done in Aurdino Programming. 
2. One can see the list of all sensors available and can see thier sensorID and can delete them. 
5. Particular Sensor Data would be recieved by Dashboard in Real-Time and After Combining all three values would provide a result that Water is Safe to Drink or not.
